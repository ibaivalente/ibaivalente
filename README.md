## ABOUT ME

After graduating from a Data Science Bootcamp at The Bridge: Digital Talent Accelerator, I enrolled at a Web Development Professional Certificate, using Angular & APS.NET Core. I combine soft skills with technical knowledge in order to provide effective web solutions and accurate data analysis.

I consider myself a thorough and careful person, with initiative to make decisions and overcome difficulties, and ready to work in a team. I am very curious and eager to learn about upcoming technology breakthroughs, such as AI. You can check out my LinkedIn profile right here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibaivalentelavado/
